# Snake via PyGame

My implementation of the famous game, which I played on the old Nokia 3310 phone.

There is also a 'self-driving' mode. Here the snake wants to locally minimize the torus distance, but also keeps track of the graph structure of the complement of its body, so that it does not end up in a dead end.
